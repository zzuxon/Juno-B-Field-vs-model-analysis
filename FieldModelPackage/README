This package solves for the magnetic field components in Jupiter's magnetosphere.

Compile by calling @prepFunctions.

The main function is found in jovMagField.pro.  The current available models are ‘VIP4’, ‘VIT4’, ‘VIPAL’, ‘Khurana’, ‘CANSheet,’ and ‘JM09’.  See comments in that file for use.

footpoint.pro is used to do magnetic field line tracings.

Use ctimeOfDPLT.pro to get a default time to use in Khurana model.
